      To break it down into the simplest way of looking at it, a stroke is a <strong>brain attack</strong>. To get a little more specific, it is a sudden loss of brain function as a result that is the result of one of two things, which is also how we categorize strokes.
    </p>

      <p>
      Depending on what part of the brain is affected by the stroke will largely determine what the symptoms and long-term effects will be.
      That being said, often it is the area of the brain that deals with sight that can be affected, resulting in a variety of optical symptoms.
      Blurred vision, dimming vision (often likened to a curtain falling) or even complete loss of vision has been reported as a symptom of stroke, either just before or during the episode. While often any impairment on vision associated with stroke is temporary, permanent optical problems, including vision lost can occur.
      This is why knowing that to look out for is so important.

        If you have trouble sitting down without falling or having trouble walking without good balance you may be having a stroke.
        Often you will lose balance from a stroke because one side of your body is affected (and therefore weakened).

        Just like a stroke can affect the part of the brain that is associated with sight, it can also affect the part of the brain that has to do with speech.<br>
        Trouble speaking or even confusing ones words are signs of a stroke.
        Trying to speak but slurring one's words or being unable to speak are also signs that you could be having a stroke.
        Many people report feeling confused in mid conversation and can be unaware that they are suffering from a stroke. <br>
        <strong>Aphasia</strong> is the name for a communication disorder that is the result of damage or injury to a part of the brain, often caused by a stroke.
        As is characteristic of aphasia, it impedes a person's ability to use or understand words.
        It is important to note, however, that aphasia doesn't affect a person's intelligence, just the way in which they communicate.
        This can prove very frustrating for sufferers, because they feel as though they are always searching for the right word.

        A common symptom of stroke is the experiencing of weakness in one's arms and legs.
        Medical professionals encourage individuals who might be experiencing a stroke to perform a self-test, which includes having the ability to lift one's arms. <br>
        Given the nature of a stroke and how they can affect the brain, it is important to realize that many different signs may present themselves, and it is up to you to decipher and seek medical attention if needed.<br>
        Following a stroke, many victims report a weakness on one side of the body, refers to as hemiparesis.
        When this occurs, a person still has the ability to move the affected side of the body, however, there will be a noticeable reduction in strength. Hemiparesis affects 8 out of 10 stroke survivors.

      <p>
        Along with weakness, trouble speaking and vision problems, facial paralysis of some degree is a very common symptom of a stroke. <br>
        When a stroke is occurring, it is symptomatic for the individual to experience one side of their face going numb or even paralyzed.
        This has to do with the area of the brain that controls facial muscles become damaged.
        The fact that it only occurs to <strong>one side of the face</strong> is a very clear sign that a stroke might be the mitigating factor.<br>
        Facial paralysis is often accompanied with slight pain in the face, dizziness, difficulty in speaking, and inability to express emotion, tearing of the eye, drooling, muscle twitching and a dryness of the mouth and eye.
        These symptoms are important to note even if you are at low risk of having a stroke, because the ability to recognize this in someone else could save their lives. <br>
        While facial paralysis is a common symptom of stroke, it can be attributed to other causes such as an infection or inflammation of the facial nerves, head trauma or a head or neck tumor.
        Ear infection, high blood pressure, diabetes, and Lyme disease are all other possibilities for facial paralysis, but all warrant a trip to the doctor's office if they are experienced.

        It would seem near impossible to speak about any ailment or medical condition that didn't involve pain in some form or another.
        From dull and constant to sharp and sudden, pain is always a good indicator that something with our bodies is askew.<br>
        For the most part, strokes are not usually painful; however, it is for this reason, among others, that strokes have been subdivided. <br>
        Ischemic stroke, or a blockage stroke, is the most common type of stroke and is relatively painless when experienced, although the after effects can be quite disarming. <br>
        Hemorrhagic strokes, on the other hand, are the type of stroke that involves bleeding (internally) and typically is painful. <br>
        If you notice sudden pain in your face, chest, or arms, along with other symptoms on this list, you should contact a healthcare professional immediately.

        Anything that affects the brain, from trauma to stroke, has the potential for cognitive disablement.<br>
        A feeling of confusion, or a constant second-guessing of ones actions can sometimes appear days before a stroke occurs, but sadly, most people just brush it off as having a bad day or another side effect of getting old. <br>
        If you suddenly notice that another person doesn't understand what you are saying to them, yet it should be simple, you might be experiencing a stroke.
        On the inverse, if you are having a difficulty with understanding other people during what should be basic conversation; it might be worth seeing a doctor, as your primitive and proactive behavior could help you prevent a stroke all together.<br>

        Headaches are indicative of many different illnesses, conditions and events; however, they should still be viewed and considered in each case.
        Given what we know about strokes, it makes sense that some degree of feeling would migrate to the head during the experience. <br>
        Many people who have suffered a stroke report experiencing a sudden, server, migraine type headache. Very often, many people's headaches are accompanied with a feeling of dizziness, nausea and vomiting. <br>
        For reasons not yet known or explained, statistically speaking, women experience this symptom more often than men. It is also worth noting, that people who reporting experience this symptom also experienced regular migraines and headaches.

        In simple terms; a stroke is a brain attack, and your brain controls and deciphers your senses, so when your brain is damaged, so can your ability to received, and more importantly perceive, the senses. <br>
        We have already touched on sight earlier and a little on touch, but smell and taste can also be impacted during the onset of a stroke, as well as similar affects being found long lasting. <br>
        Anosmia is known what doctors refer to a altered or loss of the sense of smell, while a change or distorted change in taste is known as dysgeusia. Both of these can occur in varying degrees as a result of a minor or major stroke.

        A common symptom of a stroke is the sudden onset of fatigue. Typically, this is will effect a victim fast and without warning, ultimately, with there being no logical explanation for the lethargy. <br>
        Fatigue, much like the symptom of confusion, can often present itself days if not weeks prior to a stroke. It is for this reason that it is so important that you are aware of your body and feelings, so that you can be aware of sudden and unexplained changes. <br>
